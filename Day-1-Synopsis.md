1. **Two ways to teach** - Teachers, we have a problem. Our colleagues teach poorly, but there is plenty of research on how to teach well. Today we will use the research to learn the craft of teaching, which is a lot like the craft of theatre: your lesson plan is your script. There are well-tested rules to help you write a good script, and there are well-tested rules to help you bring that script to life in the classroom. 

2. **The Goal of Teaching** - Humans store knowledge as mental models saved in the long term memory. Adding to these models is a three step process:
    1. We hold new information in our short term memory, which is very small.
    2. We build relationships between the information and existing models by expending cognitive load, which is very limited.
    3. We use the new model repeatedly so it does not fade away, but becomes easy to recall.
    The goal of teaching is to guide your students through these steps to build a useful mental model. You'll know if your performance succeeded if your students can begin doing things that require the new mental models. 

3. **Teaching as Performance** - To help students do Steps 1 and 2, you must present clearly and structure your delivery into an easily digestible sequence. There are rules that can help you do this. Many of them take advantage of your students' enormous capacity to absorb visual information. But rules are not enough---to become good at teaching you must practice and seek feedback.

4. **Teaching as Audience Participation (Formative Feedback + Motivation)** - Each of the steps requires your student to do something---especially Step 3. You cannot do the work for the student, but you can motivate them to do it. You can also ensure they are doing the right thing. In fact, you must; because otherwise the student will reinforce the wrong mental models. Again, there are well-tested rules for building motivation and providing feedback to both the student and yourself. 

5. **Bring it all together into a lesson pattern** - You can use these well-tested patterns to design your own lessons. Each pattern applies what you have learned to teach in an effective way.
