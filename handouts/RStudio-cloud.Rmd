# Welcome to RStudio Cloud

RStudio Cloud is a free cloud based version of the RStudio IDE. Your students do not need to install any software to use RStudio Cloud; it requires only an internet connection. All of their work is saved to the cloud, which means that your students can come back to their RStudio Cloud projects later, even from a different computer.
